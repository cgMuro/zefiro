# Blog Application

It's a website where people can publish articles.         
The application is deployed with heroku and you can see it live [here](https://warm-fjord-18553.herokuapp.com/).     
(The design is still a work in progress)

On the frontend I used React, Bootstrap, and [Editor.js](https://editorjs.io/).            
The backend is built using Node.js and Express for the server, along with MongoDB and Mongoose for the database.

### How to use it
You can install all the dependecies by running in the root folder:

```
npm run backend-install
npm run frontend-install
```

To run the application locally you can simply use in the root folder:
```
npm run dev
```
